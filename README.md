# A Telegram bot, in Java (and Kotlin)

## Content
This projet file demonstrates the usage of a Telegram messenger application bot. It implements several features:

- Implementation of commands in menu
- Basic text replies
- A hangman game (in French)
- Getting data from REST APIs online (for getting famous cat quotes and BTC values)
- Simple image processing filters (adding a logo using alpha, sepia filtering, meme generator etc.).

## Audience
This bot is targeted at students with an existing background in programming, mainly in Java. It also demonstrates functional ways of handling data (in the Kotlin part). It was made to demonstrate some things taught in the [*Computer science and communication* bachelor's degree at the School of engineering in Sion, Switzerland](https://www.hevs.ch/isc).

## Demonstration
A running instance of the bot can be reached through https://telegram.me/HEI_ISCbot if you want to test it and if it's running.

## Building and running
The projet is built using `maven` and I personnaly used _IntelliJ_ as the IDE. Getting the repo from here and running:
```
mvn compile package
```

should result in a runnable JAR file in the `target` directory. Voil√† !


## Running your own chat instance
If you want to run this code on your chat, you have to the set the environment variable `BOT_TOKEN` with the proper authentication token generated by Telegram's Botfather.
